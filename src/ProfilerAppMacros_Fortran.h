c PROFILE_START(NAME,LEVEL)
c This is the primary call to start a timer.  Only one call within a file 
c may call the timer.  Any other calls must use PROFILE_START2(X).
c This call will automatically add the file and line number to the timer.

     call GLOBAL_PROFILE_START( NAME, __FILE__, __LINE__, LEVEL )


c PROFILE_STOP(NAME,LEVEL)
c This is the primary call to stop a timer.  Only one call within a file 
c may call the timer.  Any other calls must use PROFILE_STOP2(X).
c This call will automatically add the file and line number to the timer.
c An optional argument specifying the level to enable may be included.
#define PROFILE_STOP(NAME,LEVEL) \

c PROFILE_SYNCHRONIZE()
c This will synchronize time zero across all processors.
c In a MPI program, the different processes may start a slightly
c different times.  Since we often want to examine the timers
c on different processors we need to synchronize time zero so it is 
c consistent.  
c Note:  This program should be called once after MPI has been initialized.
c   it does not need to be called in a serial program and there is no benifit
c   to multiple calls.
c Note: this is blocking call.
